Road of Trying was  2 mile road leading downhill to the ocean through the vast lava field next to the farm I was living at during most of my time spent on island of Hawaii.

<br/>
It was all [rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava#ʻAʻā), porous in structure and reddish in color, with inclusions of all kinds of tiny crystals, with green [olivine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivine) dots being most abundant. Rock was very sharp, making every fall, (there were quite a few of them), result in blood and deep scratches.

<br/>
Almost no one hiked there (locals were using rugged all wheel drives to get down to the ocean to do fishing). Most certainly no one was crazy enough to hike all the way down to ocean and then back uphill. Lots of times in the beginning, I would decisively set out to hike down, and then would fall almost immediately, bloodying my knees and making the hike impossible. I then would wait for several days for limbs to heal enough (I have noticed that wounds heal faster when constantly exposed to fresh air), ask myself: "WTF, I can't hike down some road?" and try again. After slowing down to a crawl, after thinking through how every interaction of my foot with rock would affect my movement, I was able to hike there consistently with no blood on myself. During hikes back uphill the sole purpose of my existence was how to make the next step and how to get to that tree, growing on the next curve, with a bit of shade left. And it was getting hot, very very hot. At lunchtime, when sun was high, the rock was getting as hot as frying pan. It was hot from the sun above, it was hot from the hot rock below. I was wearing just swim shorts and footwear, and was getting dehydrated every single hike.

<br/>
But if I managed to hike all the way down, I was rewarded with the sight of beautiful crystal clear ocean, with the loud sound of thousands ever persistent waves slamming fiercely at cliffs. I could see tens of miles of island shoreline in every direction, with only human company made by fishermen on some days.

<br/>
There also were [beautiful white birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropicbird). I have not ever seen them land, eat, or do anything else other than flying. And they were flying amazingly, effortlessly, weightlessly. They were perfect in every way, having nothing extra, with everything made for flying. There also were [goats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_goat). Lava field was all sharp and uneven rock, making it impossible to navigate through. Goats were running there and enjoying themselves. There were playful and curious young goats, bearded and horned older goats. They just lived there, feeding on tree leaves, hurting no one. I have also seen there [ants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant), [centipedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centipede), [turtles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_turtle), colorful fish, cats, [mongooses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongoose), different birds. There also were [trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrosideros_polymorpha), just growing on rock, having plenty of hot Hawaiian sun and, occasionally, lots of rain.

<br/>
I have learned a lot from the Road of Trying, chiefly patience, persistence and resilience. Also that hiking downhill is much harder than hiking uphill. I saw Earth in the raw, similar to the way it was billions of years ago, when there was nothing but lava and ocean. I also saw how beautiful life can be and felt how hot the sun can be. I have learned to love sun, which has burned me to blood multiple times, but rewarded me with its energy once I have adapted enough. I saw little bit of the endless beauty of Nature.

<br/>
An aspiration to learn continuously is driving me through the life.
